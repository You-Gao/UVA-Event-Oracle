Much less attention has been given to the narratives recorded or paraphrased by Xuanzang, particularly when they differ from the \"standard\" versions in extant Indian Buddhist texts. Even less research has been done on the soemtimes quite detailed stories about relics or/and images of the Buddha in different places on the South Asian subcontinent. This talk will discuss and contextualize the cases of the famous Buddha image and relics in the Northwest (Gandhara) and the miraculous Buddha statue in Bodhgaya.\n",
