For thousands of years, Yes, the people of the Monacan Nation, have lived on, protected and cultivated the lands on which the University of Virginia, built on colonized land by enslaved laborers, stands. As ancient peoples who thrive today, we acknowledge and respect their stewardship of the land past, present, and future. Several members of the Department of Environmental Sciences are actively involved in building relationships between UVA, the Monacan Nation, and Native American peoples elsewhere, and are committed to progressing institutional frameworks and an academic culture that support, value, and amplify Native American and Indigenous students, scholars, and community members.
