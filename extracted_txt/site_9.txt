Batten Hour: With Daniel Reifsnyder
Monday, April 15 | 12:301:30pm
Reifsnyder is a lecturer in public policy at the Batten School with a 40-year career in federal service focused mostly on environmental issues. This semester he teaches Multilateral Environmental Negotiations, which provides an overview of multilateral environmental negotiations writ large. Though each treaty is unique, all must overcome similar problems to ensure a fair and equitable outcome  and deliver real benefits. The course considers the inner workings of the processes national governments use to address global environmental challenges, allowing students to gain extensive insight into the treaty-making process internationally and domestically which can have direct applications to other issue areas, from human health to outer space.
