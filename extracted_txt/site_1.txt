Thursday, April 11 | 121:15p.m.
Join in person or online as Professor Deeg of Cardiff University presents on one of the major sources used for the study of early medieval Buddhism: "Record of the Western Regions of the Great Tang" by Chinese monk Xuanzang (600/602-664).The focus has been and still in on the value of the text for archaeology and historical geography: through the information given in the "Record" places and sites linked to the historical Buddha Sakyamuni have been identified and excavated. Much less attention has been given to the narratives recorded or paraphrased by Xuanzang, particularly when they differ from the "standard" versions in extant Indian Buddhist texts. Even less research has been done on the soemtimes quite detailed stories about relics or/and images of the Buddha in different places on the South Asian subcontinent. This talk will discuss and contextualize the cases of the famous Buddha image and relics in the Northwest (Gandhara) and the miraculous Buddha statue in Bodhgaya.
