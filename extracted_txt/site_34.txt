 On the Wrong Side of Christ: Female Damned in Texts and Monumental Paintings 
 Wednesday, April 24, 2024 
 12:30 pm | Zoom 
 Please join AISEES on April 24 for a lecture by Marina Mandrikova. The lecture will begin at 9:30 a.m. PT / 12:30 p.m. EST / 7:30 p.m. in Eastern Europe. 
"On the Wrong Side of Christ: Female Damned in Texts and Monumental Paintings" investigates images of female damned in Byzantine, Post-Byzantine, andSlavic monumental paintings between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries and explores theircomplex and surprising relationships to written sources that describe the punishment of womenat the end of time. After a brief general survey on the topic, this talk considers the most criticalapocalyptic and educational Christian texts that describe sinful women and their torments in Helland discusses how Early Christian and medieval Byzantine writers perceived and describedsinful women. By exploring the surviving visual evidence, primarily from modern-day Greeceand the Slavic-speaking countries of Bulgaria, Serbia, Kosovo, and North Macedonia, this studythen examines the inconsistencies between textual descriptions of the damned and their dramaticrepresentations on the walls of churches. This presentation also intends to raise awareness aboutthe current issues of their preservation. Parts of this talk have been previously presentedelsewhere.

 Dorothy Wong: Udayana Statues Travelling 
 5:30 pm PST | McMurty 370, Stanford University 
According to legend, the Buddha ascended to the Heaven of Thirty-Three to preach to the gods and to his deceased mother, Queen My, who had been reborn there. Missing the Buddhas presence on earth, King Udayana commissioned a statue made in his likeness. Centuries later, sculptures inscribed as Udayana statues (Youtian wang xiang ) appeared; copies were produced and worshipped as First Images. Udayana statues belong to a special category of Buddhist images attributed with special powers, known as ruixiang  (auspicious images) in Chinese. They can move about, levitate, and can refuse to be moved. As emblems of Buddhist kingship and institutional orthodoxy, the statue and its copies were much sought after and were carried from place to place, displayed in ritual processions, and ensconced in palaces or monasteries for worship. Legends of Udayana statues are recorded in a variety of literary sources, from canonical Buddhist texts to biographies of monks, travelogues of pilgrim-monks, miraculous tales, and historical chronicles. In addition to sculptures, narratives of Udayana statues are also depicted in mural paintings, woodblock prints, and scroll paintings. Using both literary and visual evidence, this paper examines the geography traversed and the ritual and sacred spaces occupied by these extraordinary statues.

Admission is always FREE
This dynamic selection of 20th- and 21st-century artworks from the Museums permanent collection explores the ways that art can speak to or question the formal, physical, environmental, social, and institutional structures of our world.Here you will encounter the work of Robert Reed, whose abstract paintings and collages contain coded references to his life and memories. The depopulated architectural paintings of Emilio Snchez invite us to contemplate our built environment. DJ and visual artist Rozeal addresses racism and the complexities of cultural appropriation and globalization in our current times. Alberto Rey encourages viewers to consider their own ecological surroundings from which we are often disconnected. These connections to regional resources and materials are also seen in the work of Maria and Julian Martinez, who innovated upon ancient forms of pottery in ways that still inspire Pueblo artists. Oftentimes, multiple structures are present in the same artwork, providing pathways and opportunities for interpretation and inquiry. From paintings to collages, from pottery to jewelry, the artworks in this exhibition inspire conversations about how our world is structured. This exhibition is curated by Laura Minton, Curator of Exhibitions; Adriana Greci Green,Curator of Indigenous Arts of the Americas; Emily Lazaro, Docent Coordinator; and Rebekah Boggs, former Tour Coordinator and Education Assistant.
