George Klosko, presenter at the Political Theory Colloquium
The Political Theory Colloquium brings together UVA faculty and graduate students to discuss new and in-progress work in political theory. Visitors are drawn from UVAs faculty and beyond, and they reflect the wide range of work being done in the field. Regular participation in the colloquium is an important component of the subfields professionalization and graduate training, and should be a priority for all students. The colloquium also welcomes everyone who is interested in political theory and cognate fields.Papers are distributed in advance, and participants come prepared to discuss them.
Preliminary abstracts for each paper that is being presented are available below. Paper drafts will be circulated 710 days before the talk via e-mail. Participants of the colloquium are responsible making themselves familiar with the circulated draft prior to the beginning of the talk. Each speaker will introduce their work with a few brief remarks. Then, an assigned discussant (in most cases, graduate students in our Department) will raise a few preliminary talking points about the draft. After the speaker responds to those comments, anyone in attendance may raise their hand and ask questions about the paper.
Please contact Jean-Marc Pruitif you would like to be added to the email distribution list for papers, if you require any accommodations to participate in the speaker series, or if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.
Unless otherwise noted, the colloquium meets 2:00-3:30pm Eastern time.
