## UVA Event Oracle (www.yougao.dev/UVA-Event-Oracle/)
This project is designed to scrape events from a list of UVA calendar sites within different departments and process them into a structured format (JSON or CSV). It utilizes '**requests**' and '**Selenium**' for web scraping, allowing for interaction with JavaScript-rendered content. 

The technical motivation of the project was wanting to use LLMs, specifically '**VertexAI**' (Google Cloud AI), to extract and create a JSON file from processed HTML files. However, what drove me was a more personal goal to explore what was going on around UVA and the different seminars that were being hosted.
